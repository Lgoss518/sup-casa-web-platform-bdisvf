[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "SUP CASA is a modern, user-friendly educational web platform designed specifically to centralize, organize, and share academic resources for students in Casablanca\u2019s higher education community. The primary aim of SUP CASA is to eliminate the chaos of scattered study materials\u2014typically shared through WhatsApp groups, emails, or various isolated drives\u2014by creating a unified digital ecosystem where every student can easily access lessons, tutorials, exam papers, and corrected exercises. The site features two main interfaces: a professional, intuitive user portal for students and a secure, password-protected admin panel. In the user portal, students can instantly browse and filter documents according to their level (S1 through S9), subject, or type (course notes, practicals, or exams), benefiting from advanced search options and a clean, responsive design suited for any device. All resources published on the platform are curated and uploaded by an admin, guaranteeing quality and organizational consistency. The admin panel, accessible only with a secure password, allows administrators to upload files (supporting PDF, Word, images, and more), specify document titles, academic levels, subjects, and types, and manage the library efficiently. The backend architecture is designed for simplicity and scalability\u2014even though the demo version uses local storage for uploads, the structure anticipates a future shift to cloud hosting or database integration for multi-user, persistent collaboration. SUP CASA\u2019s long-term vision is to foster academic success by promoting sharing, collaboration, and digital literacy among students. Planned features for future evolution include user accounts, notification systems, discussion spaces, and possibly a dedicated mobile app\u2014all while preserving the elegance, accessibility, and efficiency that are at the heart of SUP CASA\u2019s mission: empowering students to study smarter, together, and to build a strong, collaborative academic community for Casablanca."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want to build a React Native + Expo 54 app called SUP CASA, which is an educational platform for students in Casablanca.

This screen should have advanced search options.\n*   **Document Display:** A screen to display the selected document, with support for PDF, Word, images, etc.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#3f51b5` (Indigo)\n    *   Secondary: `#e91e63` (Pink)\n    *   Accent: `#03a9f4` (Light blue)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffc107` (Amber)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Read existing files:** Use the `read_file_tree` tool to get a list of all files in the project.\n2.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:**\n    *   Implement the Home Screen/Dashboard with a search bar and featured resources.\n    *   Implement the Browse/Filter Screen with filtering options.\n    *   Implement the Document Display screen.\n3.  **Modify app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx:**\n    *   Update the tab bar to include icons and labels for the Home Screen, Browse/Filter Screen, and Profile screen.\n4.  **Remove modalDemos array:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's start by reading the file tree.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have the file tree.
